# teeworlds-fng-maps

The main aim of this repository is to handle a lot of FNG maps for Teeworlds, but there also some scripts helping to manage all these maps:

 - generateVotesCfg.sh : generate all votes in stdout
 - run.sh : wrapper to run a server in order to add random maps feature to votes
 - sendToServer.sh : script allowing to send commands to the econ

Patched file to allow a lot of votes in the server side : game/voting.h
